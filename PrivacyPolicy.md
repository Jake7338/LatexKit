# Privacy Policy
Ok, this is going to be short!

## Nitty-gritty
We do not collect personal information of any kind from the users of the [LatexKit]. Simple as that!

## What data is processed?
The code only processes the information in the cells that are selected (or assigned through the advanced options) for latex or raw data tables generation. Everything happens in the google's servers.

This is why this add-on needs access to your spreadsheets!

## But, but... why do you need access to my Google Drive?
We do not read any files from your Drive. However, the advanced capabilities of the add-on allow the users to generate multiple tables in separate files that are saved in the specified folder in the user's Drive.
