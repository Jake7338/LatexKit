# LatexKit Privacy Policy

Effective: March 27, 2021

Last update: March 26, 2021

Ok, this is going to be short!

## Nitty-gritty
We do not collect personal information from the users of the [LatexKit]. Simple as that! We collect only **anonymous** Add-on usage statistics. These include:

- Add-on menu clicks (which menu options are used and how many times).
- LatexKit features used.
- Tables' size.

The purpose of this data is to better understand how users interact with LatexKit and help making decisions about its future.

## What data is processed?
The code only processes the information in the cells that are selected (or assigned through the advanced options) for LaTeX or raw data tables generation. Everything happens in the Google's servers.

This is why this add-on needs access to your spreadsheets!

## But, but... why do you need access to my Google Drive?
We do not read any files from your Drive. However, the advanced capabilities of the add-on allow the users to generate multiple tables in separate files that are saved in the specified folder in the user's Drive.
