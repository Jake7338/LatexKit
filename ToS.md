## Changes to the Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 15 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.

The add-ons are examined to insure they meet Google's guidelines, including guidelines for safeguarding user data, before they are publicly available. For more information, see the [Add-on review].

## Disclaimer
We do not guarantee, or warrant that your use of the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, and you agree that we may remove the Add-on service for indefinite time periods, or discontinue the service at any time, without notice to you.

## Digital information loss
The Service can create, permanently modify and permanently remove files (and folders) inside the user's Google Drive on behalf of the user when so requested by the user through the use of the Service. The files and/or folders are modified and/or removed based on the file's and folder's names indicated by the user. As an end user of the Service, you expressly agree that you are responsible for any loss of information that you might incur through the use of the Service, including the following, but not limited to, exemplary cases:

1) You modify a file previously created through the Service and afterwards request an update of the same file through the Service.

2) You name a file with the exact same name previously designated as an output file of the Service and afterwards you request the creation of an output file with that name that will replace your original file, on your behalf, as requested.

## Software updates
The Add-on which you use may automatically install updates from time to time. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions with different features. You agree to receive such updates and permit the LatexKit team to deliver them to you as part of your use of the Services.

## Intellectual Property

## Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Portugal, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.
