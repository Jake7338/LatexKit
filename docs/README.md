**Bridging the gap between LaTeX tables and Google Sheets**

## Features
* Export multiple tables at once.
* Individual settings for each table.
* Hlines templates.
* Bigstrut.
* Manual column type configuration.
* Uncertainty `+/-` notation, i.e. merge values column with errors column.

* Export data to text files with swapped columns.
